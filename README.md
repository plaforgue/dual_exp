This repository contains code to reproduce the experiments from *Duality in RKHSs with Infinite Dimensional Outputs: Application to Robust Losses* by P. Laforgue, A. Lambert, L. Brogat-Motte, and F. d'Alch√©-Buc, published in the proceedings of ICML 2020 [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04621)].


To re-run the experiments (WARNING: it will erase previous saved results upon swhich plots are based), run:
- Kae_results.py
- Lip_results.py
- Yeast_results.py

To reproduce the plots, run:
- Kae_plot.py
- Lip_plot.py
- Yeast_plot_all.py
